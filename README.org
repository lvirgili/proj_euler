* Project Euler solutions
  These are my solutions to the projecteuler.net problems.

  I am putting them here for two reasons:
  1. I lost all my solutions and cannot access my original account as
     it is said that my email is already used by another account
     (weird).
  2. To make myself respect the "one minute rule" and not just try the
     brute force solution, go take a coffee and come back after a
     while to the solution.

  Remember: trying to solve the problems is the fun
  part. Understanding the math behind them and learning new things is
  what matters, not just getting the large green tick in the
  screen. Whenever I used something not trivial to solve the problem I
  put in the comments where the resource was found.

  So far, there are solutions in:
  1. Julia (most of them)
  2. Haskell
  3. Ruby
  4. C++
  5. Using google to calculate 40!/(20!20!) =P
